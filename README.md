# URL Shortener

URL Shortener is a scalable and efficient link-shortening service built with Rust (Actix Web) for the backend, Next.js for the frontend, and Supabase (PostgreSQL) as the database.

## üöÄ Live Demo
The system is currently deployed at:
[https://url-shortener-steel-ten.vercel.app/](https://url-shortener-steel-ten.vercel.app/)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
Due to the long URL generated by Vercel, the system does not work as expected. To make it fully functional, a shorter custom domain would be required.
